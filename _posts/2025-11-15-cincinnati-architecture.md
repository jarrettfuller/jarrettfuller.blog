Last month I made a quick trip to Cincinnati, OH for the SECAC Conference, where I was presenting on a sponsored project I've been working on for the last five years. I had some time to kill before my flight on the last day and decided to engage in a quick architectural tour of the city, which had some surprisingly diverse gems. First up was Union Terminal, built at the turn of the century and featuring stunning art deco details. In a radical shift, I jumped south to see Procter and Gamble's postmodern headquarters designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox in 1986. Standing under its ornate details reminded me I'll always be a sucker for pomo. Finally, I walked over to the 
Contemporary Arts Center, designed by Zaha Hadid (and I believe her only US building) in 2003. I took tons of photos, a few favorites below.
