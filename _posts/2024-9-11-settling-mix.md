There was a time in my life — pre-kids, pre-full-time teaching, pre-homeowner, etc. — when I'd spend an unusual amount of time making playlist on Spotify (and before that Rdio and before that iTunes). They were usually seasonal but also could revolve around moods, feelings, genres. They were made to share but they were also made for me: as my music libraries grew it was harder to return to things, to find commonalities and themes. I can't help it, I'm a natural organizer.

That's a longwinded way of saying that I made a new playlist that I've been playing on repeat for the last few weeks. It's called *Settling* and features a mix of drone music and ambient guitar plucking. It's a collection of songs for a late summer morning on the front porch or an early Fall evening around the fire. 

You can listen to it on Spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1NzQ2uS3h9qAQS4Gd2ALr7?si=cab99d6826f043cb).
