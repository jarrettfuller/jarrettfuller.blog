### Playlist
As I do every year, I've put together [a playlist of my favorite new songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Xo8MIxAylLgtoQMO3gnuY?si=Bm8ygvCkRm2Nduqvn4zVnw) from the year â€” this one clocks in at just over six hours with 96 tracks. You can stream the entire thing on Spotify for listen here:
