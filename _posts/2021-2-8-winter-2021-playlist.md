*Another Kind of Life*is the third in what’s become an annual series of winter playlists, beginning with 2019’s [*We Can Hear When We Are Hollow*](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/winter19) and followed by 2020’s [*A Ship Out to Nowhere*](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/winter20). That first playlist was an attempt at capturing the feeling of walking through New York in the middle of winter — fresh snow on the ground, grey skies, and a strange tranquility in the streets. * A Ship Out to Nowhere* followed this tone but, I think, expanded on it a bit.

I’ve been making playlists for nearly two decades but these two are some of my very favorites and I hope this is third entry into the series. What I like about them is that they feel like the perfect distillation of my favorite kind of music: slow, ambient, quiet, reflective. (As Jeff Tweedy sings in a new Weezer song: *all my favorite songs are slow and sad*.[^1] These playlists, then, show the connective threads between an otherwise eclectic set of musical tastes. This year’s playlist blends ambient electronic and solo piano, lo-fi folk and post-punk. I hope you enjoy it!

You can find all my previous playlists [here](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/) or follow along on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/jarrettfuller).

[^1]: I’m not a Weezer fan and likely couldn’t tell you the name of any Weezer song but I heard this line on on a recent episode of All Songs Considered and it describes my musical tastes perfectly. My partner even noticed that I tend to lean towards sad Christmas songs each year too.
