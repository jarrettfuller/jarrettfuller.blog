“Is that what being an artist means—selling? I thought it meant one who is always seeking without finding. I thought it meant the contrary from ‘I know it. I have found it.’ When I say I am an artist, I only mean ‘I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.’”

—Vincent van Gogh, from Irving Stone’s biographical novel, *Lust for Life*
