New York’s been grey. Sometimes I think winter in New York — winter *without snow* in New York, at least — is my favorite New York. It feels quiet. Slow. Meditative? I’ve found myself moving through the city, grey skies above me, headphones in, and walking just a bit slower. [*A Ship Out to Nowhere*](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6DsawyjwjXCUmxeKGUhZ24?si=mkrp1g7JQKaQgZD41phXzA) is my new playlist, a soundtrack for these walks through the city. (I think of this playlist as a sequel of sorts to last years, [*We Can Hear When We are Hollow*](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/winter19).)

When I make these playlists, I’m trying to capture a feeling, a particular emotional moment, and that usually is drawn from the weather, which might be why these are so tightly tied to seasons.   As I wrote above, I wanted this set of songs to feel like walking through New York in the winter. Sometimes I’m after the energy of summer or the birth of new life that comes with Spring.

I’m also looking for an arc, a movement. I think a lot about how the songs flow from one to the next, how each track leads to another and weaves through different genres and feelings. I tend to like starting slow, building to a peak in the middle of the track list, before tapering off again. My favorite playlists, the ones I turn to again and again, have the strongest arcs and immediately take me back to the time and place of their creation. In the end, I guess, these are simply time capsules, for myself and, I hope, for you too. Thanks for listening.
