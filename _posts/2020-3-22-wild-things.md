When despair for the world grows in me<br>
and I wake in the night at the least sound<br>
in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,<br>
I go and lie down where the wood drake<br>
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.<br>
I come into the peace of wild things<br>
who do not tax their lives with forethought<br>
of grief. I come into the presence of still water.<br>
And I feel above me the day-blind stars<br>
waiting with their light. For a time<br>
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.<br>
