I hope yesterday’s surprisingly 90° high in New York was a blip in our otherwise strong march into Fall. I’ve gotten out my sweaters and switched from my short sleeve work uniform back to the long sleeve. I also finally finished [my new Fall playlist](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/fall19) which is now available for streaming on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Mpmr4HwysWHr6TSAASTbg?si=k5fLhjAKR2uxuVokAdrLvA)! It’s called *Heroes and Ghosts / Graveyards and Buildings* and is a mix of both old and new songs to accompany you through the season.

Here’s the tracklisting:

1. *Design Guide* - William Doyle and Brian Eno
2. *Feverer* - Saintseneca
3. *Tickets To Crickets* - Ferraby Lionheart
4. *Into the Red* - James Blake
5. *Take Me To The Light* - Francis and the Lights (feat. Bon Iver and Kanye West)
6. *ET* - Kweku Collins
7. *Half Joking* - Charles Rumback and Ryley Walker
8. *Removed* - Calexico
9. *Guilt* - Pygmy Lush
10. *Husks and Shells* - Volcano Choir
11. *Gratitude* - Big Red Machine
12. *Powder Blue / Cascine Park* - Yumi Zouma
13. *Hey Rosey* - The National
14. *Survivalist Fantasy* - Kyle Morton
15. *Here It Comes (The Road) Let's Go* - Spiritualized
16. *Pictures of You* - The Cure

I used to make playlists for every season but its become sporadic in recent years, prompted when the mood strikes. I’ve always loved my Fall playlists and it was nice to get back into it. In many ways, this feels like a sequel — or at least companion mix — to [my Winter mix](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/winter19) from [earlier this year](https://www.jarrettfuller.blog/2019/03/winter-playlist/). As always, you can see all my previous playlists [here](https://jarrettfuller.com/playlists/) and they’re all available on Spotify.
