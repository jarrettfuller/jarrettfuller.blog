description: Some of my favorite writing from the last year.
---

Every year, I keep a running archive of my favorite essays from the year [on Are.na](https://www.are.na/jarrett-fuller/2019-favorite-reads) — pieces that grab me, essays that move me, opinions that challenge me, or profiles that inspire me. Over the years, I’ve assembled best of lists to highlight the writing — mostly online — that have stuck with me throughout the year to bring them some attention once again.

Below are a few favorites from 2019, but the entire list can be found on [this Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/jarrett-fuller/2019-favorite-reads).

*The New Yorker* published some wonderful artist profiles this year and I devoured almost all of them. I read Dana Goodyear’s [profile of filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and his new film loosly based on Gerhard Richter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/21/an-artists-life-refracted-in-film) on a train all the way back in January and I still find myself thinking about it. Goodyear also had a [great profile on photographer Thomas Joshua Cooper](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/07/a-photographer-at-the-ends-of-the-earth), who I admittedly was unfamiliar with before her piece but completely fell in love with his work.

I also loved Doreen St. Felix [on Virgil Abloh](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/18/virgil-abloh-menswears-biggest-star), Calvin Tomkins [on Vija Celmins](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/02/vija-celmins-surface-matters), Joshua Rothman [on Peter Sacks](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/25/an-artists-archeology-of-the-mind), Ian Parker [on Dan Mallory](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions), and Michael Schulman [on Adam Driver](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/adam-driver-the-original-man).

Speaking of profiles, Taffy Brodesser-Akner is one of my favorite profile writers and her profiles [on Tom Hanks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/movies/tom-hanks-mister-rogers.html) and [Marianne Williamson](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/magazine/marianne-williamson-2020.html) were favorites. (Taffy, by the way, also happened to write one of my favorite novels of the year, [*Fleishman is in Trouble*](https://amzn.to/36EcsfL)!)

Much like Uber and Theranos few years ago, I loved reading about the swift rise and fall of WeWork and Adam Neumann. [*New York’s* Reeves Wiedeman had a great piece on Adam’s background and desires for WeWork](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/wework-adam-neumann.html) and Gabriel Sherman [wrote about how it all collapsed](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/wework-adam-neumann.html) for *Vanity Fair*.

For more on tech, I appreciated Paul Ford’s essay for Wired on [why he still loves tech](https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-love-tech-defense-difficult-industry/) and found Tavi Gevinson’s *New York* cover story [on how Instagram influenced her life surprisingly relatable](https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/who-would-tavi-gevinson-be-without-instagram.html).

More like these: The personal essay genre is stronger than ever. I love Jia Tolentino’s [*Losing Religion and Finding Ecstasy*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/27/losing-religion-and-finding-ecstasy-in-houston), Wil S. Hylton’s stunning and terrifying [story about how his cousin tried to kill him](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/magazine/cousin-kill-me-male-violence.html), and Leslie Jamison’s account [of experiencing a Garry Winogrand exhibition while going through a divorce](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/garry-winogrand-leslie-jamison/600805/).

Like most people I know, I read a lot about politics, identity, and government this year. [Claudia Rankine’s piece on whiteness for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/magazine/white-men-privilege.html) was fascinating and should be required reading for everyone, most of all white men.

Rebecca Traister is always good. [Rebecca Traister on Elizabeth Warren is really good](https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/elizabeth-warren-teacher-presidential-candidate.html). As I [wrote earlier in the year](https://www.jarrettfuller.blog/2019/08/elizabeth-warren/), there are many reasons why I want Warren to be our next president but one small reason is her background as a teacher. In her essay for the Cut, Traister looks at how Warren’s time in the classroom influences her approach to governing, campaigning, and communicating. Finally, I found [John Hendrickson’s essay for The Atlantic on Joe Biden’s stutter](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/joe-biden-stutter-profile/602401/) moving and fascinating. I’m not a Biden fan but I came away from the piece with much more sympathy for him.

One of my favorite — and most unexpected — essays of the year was Errol Morris’s discursive, wandering, and fascinating essay [for The New York Times on pianist Sviatoslav Richter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/21/opinion/editorials/errol-morris-lobster-sviatoslav-richter.html). It includes plastic lobsters, musings on creativity and practice, and a stunning design by the NYT design team. This one is a must read.

These aren’t essays, and I don’t listen to nearly as many podcasts as I used to, but here are a few of my favorite podcast episodes from the year:
* Errol Morris on [the Longform Podcast](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-367-errol-morris) (I mean, come on, obviously.)
* Also on Longform, I loved this conversation [with The New York Times book critic Parul Sehgal](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-371-parul-sehgal).
* And this interview with David Letterman by Conan O’Brien for his new podcast, [*Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend*](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/david-letterman/) was excellent.
