Life is short, though I keep this from my children.<br>
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine<br>
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,<br>
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways<br>
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least<br>
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative<br>
estimate, though I keep this from my children.<br>
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.<br>
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,<br>
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world<br>
is at least half terrible, and for every kind<br>
stranger, there is one who would break you,<br>
though I keep this from my children. I am trying<br>
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,<br>
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on<br>
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,<br>
right? You could make this place beautiful.

*Good Bones* by Maggie Smith (2016)
