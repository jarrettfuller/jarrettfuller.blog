I've been working my way through Abbas Kiarostami's films over the last month. I'd seen a few here and there over the years but there were big gaps in my knowledge. To watch them back to back, in short succession, is to become envoloped in his world: his meta-narratives, his language, his characters, his pacing, and most evidently: his landscapes. Watching a series of these movies in a few weeks time, I was struck by the rhyming in his cinematography, his repeated use of roads, the zig-zag compositions. With Kiarostami, I come for the structural invention but I stay for the landscapes.
