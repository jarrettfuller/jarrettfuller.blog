This semester, I’m teaching a portfolio course for juniors and seniors at Rutgers University. We’re working together to craft their body of work, to assemble a portfolio, to figure out what they want to say as designers and artists. It’s fun. It’s been nice to have new students, in a different school in a new town. Since January, once a week, I’ve been taking a train to New Brunswick, New Jersey. Due to my schedule and the train schedule, I’d get to town about an hour before my class begins and I’d spend that hour exploring the town with camera in hand.

That’s obviously not happening anymore. Classes have gone online only the rest of the semester. I’m optimistic we can keep the momentum of the class going virtually but admit to being sad losing those weekly photo sessions.
