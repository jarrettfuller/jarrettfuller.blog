I've been gardening seriously for three years now and while I've been posting updates over on my Instagram, I've never properly documented my work here on the blog. When I first started teaching, an older professor told me they thought it took teaching a class three times to really understand how to do it and what it's about. He was right about teaching and I feel like it applies to my gardening too[^1]. I seemed to find my rhythm this time around with an overwhelming bounty this summer of peppers, tomatos, eggplant, cucumbers, beans, strawberries, and various herbs[^2].

Each year, I've expanded the garden a bit, adding new vegetables to try, and revising and editing placements and  technique. I already have ideas for things I want to try next year[^3]. If you told me, even just a few years ago, that gardening would become central to my life, I'd have laughed in your face. But it's truly an all-consuming hobby for these summer months.

Over the weekend, during a brief reprieve from the heat, I spent some time photographing the progress at the mid-summer mark.

[^1]: Although maybe I should revisit this next year. My first year's garden was at our previous house and I'm only two years into my current set up?

[^2]: The peppers alone have led to various salads, a few jars of pickled peppers, and the start of a fermented hot sauce!

[^3]: I spent a lot of time this year working on flowers after animals destroyed all mine last summer. So far, so good. Flowers is where I really want to focus on building out the flower beds next year.
