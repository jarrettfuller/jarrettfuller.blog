One day you finally knew<br>
what you had to do, and began,<br>
though the voices around you<br>
kept shouting<br>
their bad advice – – –<br>
though the whole house<br>
began to tremble<br>
and you felt the old tug<br>
at your ankles.<br>
‘Mend my life!’<br>
each voice cried.<br>
But you didn’t stop.<br><br>
You knew what you had to do,<br>
though the wind pried<br>
with its stiff fingers<br>
at the very foundations – – –<br>
though their melancholy<br>
was terrible. It was already late<br>
enough, and a wild night,<br>
and the road full of fallen<br>
branches and stones.<br><br>
But little by little,<br>
as you left their voices behind,<br>
the stars began to burn<br>
through the sheets of clouds,<br>
and there was a new voice,
which you slowly<br>
recognized as your own,<br>
that kept you company<br>
as you strode deeper and deeper<br>
into the world,<br>
determined to do<br>
the only thing you could do – – – determined to save<br>
the only life you could save.
